# EGR-2800-FInal-Project
Designed and implemented the algorithm used to capture the static and kinetic coefficient of friction of a device using C++/Arduino programming languages.
This was accomplished by using laser pointers, photoresistors, a NEMA 17 motor, an MPU 6050 Accelerometer, an LCD Display, and two push switches. The code upon startup will run the welcome messages on the LCD Screen and give initial directions to the user. Once the user presses the start button, the NEMA 17 motor will start to push the arm of the linear actuator as well implement the program to convert the xyz coordinates to an angle in the x-axis plane. Once the material starts to slide the down ramp and passes the first laser, the st() function is called and collects the current time in milliseconds, the linear actuator stops, and the current angle is recorded in a variable. Once the material passes the final laser, the ft() function is called and stores the final time and does computations with all of them time and angle measurements. The static and kinetic coefficient of friction are then displayed on the LCD screen. If the user wishes to use the device again, they press the reset button to have the linear actuator return to its initial position and restarts the same process described above.
